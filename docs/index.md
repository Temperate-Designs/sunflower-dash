  more valuable than flower petals)
- Flower color are the colors in your color inventory (you slowly
  collect them while you play)

- Evil bees and worms eat or pop ball
- Butterflies and dandelion seeds carry you around
- The floor is covered with goatheads or/and cacti
- There are gopher holes that you can use to escape the obstacles but
  you have to watch out for the gopher that will chase you down the
  tunnels in the gopher holes
- In the shop you can buy a bee protective shield or 3 bee shields
  make one wasp shield
- There are wasps and they can sting faster and have a longer
  distance range

  for custom design or you can buy pre-made designs using flower
  petals
